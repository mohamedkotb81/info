<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>

    </font></center>
    <font size="5"> 
      <p>I'm Mohamed Kotb graduated from faculty of Arts - English department - at Menoufia university in 2002.</p>
          
      <p>In January 2003, I joined the armed forces as a Marine Officer for 3 years according to the great fitness at that time.</p>
          
      <p>For work experience, I worked as a teacher of English in Heliopolis Schools after graduation for one year. 
          After that, I worked as a copy-editor in Hindawi Publishing Corporation for almost two years.</p>
      
      <p>Due to my strong interest in technology, I transitioned to a role as a Content Creation Specialist at 
              Hindawi for another two years, I contributed in building and testing many tools related to publishing 
              services (word add-in plugins, mapping converters, cleaning tools, DTD, XSLT, Schemas, etc.) 
              that facilitated work by saving effort and time for the entire staff.</p>
      
      <p>My managerial career began in January 2010, when I was promoted to Content Technologies team leader with 
          Hindawi Publishing. For more than 7 years, I took a round on leading almost all Production Unit teams 
          (Markup, References, Tables, Proofreading, Finalization, Finalization QA) and achieved many projects 
          (creating new tools, testing various programs related to publishing industry, creating database to prevent 
          redundant in work, launching new journals or applying inhouse style on other journals that company bought 
          from other publishers, creating workflows, creating new functions for more specification).</p>
      
      <p>During this tenure at Hindawi, I played a critical role in the talent acquisition and development process. 
          I interviewed and selected candidates, conducted training sessions, and evaluated their performance 
          throughout the probation period. My systematic approach to onboarding and performance management ensured 
          that only the most capable and well-suited individuals were integrated into the teams. For those who were 
          not a fit, I implemented additional training or made the difficult decision to let them go (dismissal), 
          ensuring that the team maintained a high standard of competence.</p>
      
        <p>In November 2016, I was selected to be part of a team tasked with launching a new company for the same CEO 
          (Nagwa) for digital Learning, we started together in building all tools and workflows from scratch for 
          creating scientific content online.</p>
      
        <p>One of my key achievements is learning Python Programing language that I used all the time in doing daily
           work. (Scripts, Scraping, Queries, etc.)</p>
      
      <p>Throughout my 15-year managerial career, I have consistently sought to enhance my skills through various 
          professional development courses. I believe that continuous learning is key to effective leadership and 
          management. Some of the key courses I have completed are: Presentation, Communication, Problem Solving, 
          Time Management, Tropism, PMP, Strategic Thinking, KPIs and Performance Appraisals, and Self-monitoring. 
          The extensive training and courses I have undertaken have equipped me with a diverse set of skills that 
          enhance my effectiveness as a manager. I am confident that my dedication to continuous learning and 
          application of these skills will continue to drive positive outcomes in any managerial role I undertake.
